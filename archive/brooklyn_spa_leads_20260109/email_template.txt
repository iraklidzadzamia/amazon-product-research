Subject: Licensed Esthetician with Medical Background Seeking Opportunity

---

Hello,

My name is Irma Pipiya, and I recently received my NY esthetician license (600 hours, Atelier Esthetician Institute). I'm reaching out because I'm looking to join a professional team where I can grow and contribute.

What I bring:
- Medical background (Doctor of Dentistry) – strong foundation in clinical procedures and sanitation
- Fresh perspective and eagerness to learn
- Skills in facials, waxing, LED therapy, high frequency, lash extensions
- Native Russian speaker, conversational English

I'd love the opportunity to discuss how I could support your team. Would you be open to a brief conversation?

You can see some of my work on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/irmapipia1/

Thank you for your time!

Best regards,
Irma Pipiya
